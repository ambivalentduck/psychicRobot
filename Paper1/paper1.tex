\section*{Abstract}
We derive a novel modeling approach for determining movement intent from force-disturbed arm movement, examine its parameter sensitivity, and validate it on human reaching data. We demonstrate that inverting popular arm modeling approaches algebraically allows determination of movement intent from recordings of force disturbances and arm movement. We then extend this to a more general approach, which reveals strengths, limitations, and underlying assumptions. After populating our model with measured lengths and masses as well as impedance values from the literature, we perform sensitivity analysis to determine the accuracy of the model relative to the uncertainty naturally inherent in point-to-point reaching. We find that sensitivity to parameter inaccuracy is on the order of microns and lower than the inaccuracy of human reaching. Further, most of the sensitivity results from uncertainty with regard to the stiffness of the joints. The robustness of this approach indicated that it was suitable for determining reaching intent from human point-to-point reaching movements disturbed by large force pulses. Intended trajectory showed no change from undisturbed reaching for 150 ms after the onset of disturbance. Beyond this point, stiffening of the arm, change in intent, or both usually lead to deviation from undisturbed reaching. Not all disturbed reaches showed evidence of change in intent. Unlike $\lambda$ models, the reaching intent determined by our model is physiologically plausible. This success allows real-time determination of error that can free learning enhancement and treatment methods like error augmentation and challenge point from needing to prescribe explicit task goals. In addition, extraction from recorded human motion enables direct inspection of and hypothesis testing on the contents of human motor intent. While not explicitly examined, this approach is also valid for determination intent is more complex situations like team sports and national security.

\section*{Introduction}
As machines interact more and more with humans, there is a growing need for a rigorous way to understand what people are trying to do, even if they become disturbed, distracted, or influenced by pathology. One can assume that a person who is familiar with a particular task will try to do the same thing each time provided all other conditions are equal. This presumes that what people do is on average what they intended to do and that their goal remains unchanged. However, if there is a disturbance, it is unclear what happens to a person's intentions because action is decoupled from intention. Challenges arise in human-machine interactions because intention and changes in intention cannot be easily discerned. Hence a comprehensive method for understanding what someone means to do (rather than what they actually do or claim to have wanted to do) as they interact within uncertain environments will prove useful in any area where a person might be thwarted from their intent such as national security, operation of machinery, athletic and music performance, rehabilitation, human augmentation, and artificial intelligence.

It is important to distinguish our use of the term intent from other groups that consider \textit{motivation}\cite{mcclelland1985motives, rawolle2013relationships}, \textit{cost}\cite{todorov2002optimal, flash1985coordination}, or \textit{goal selection decisions}\cite{ziebart2010modeling}. In typical motor control studies, subjects are motivated to complete the experiment in a timely fashion and are usually explicitly provided targets to be reached. Classification of intent is prevalent in both lower \cite{strausser2011development, hargrove2013robotic} and upper limb\cite{englehart2003robust, young2012improving} prosthetics where hybrid control algorithms select from among a set of actions (walking/standing/flexion/extension/etc). While subjects may be \textit{motivated} to complete experiments with minimal effort/cost and their \textit{goal} may be to reach a target, here we use intent to describe the course of action (i.e., the trajectory of the arm) taken in service of goals and motives and not the goals nor the motives themselves. Particularly of interest is the intended course of action when the actual movement is disturbed and hence no longer matches the intent.

Attempts to deduce motor intent in the past have focused on the assumed spring-like properties of human muscles. Springs produce a force according to their impedance and stretch. By measuring force, impedance, and position, Gomi and Kawato\cite{gomi1997human} were able to deduce stretch and thereby infer the muscle's equilibrium point. Supporters of the so-called $\lambda$ model\cite{feldman1995origin} hypothesized that this equilibrium point represented the intent of a movement. Upon inspection of the equilibrium point as it evolved in time, it was clear that it was highly complex and often not anatomically realizable. Therefore, it could not well-represent the intent of a simple reaching movement. We propose a revised method---intent extraction---that deduces intended trajectory, even in the face of disturbances. This method describes a class of filters that map a disturbance, process, actuator, and realized trajectory to an intended trajectory. In human reaching, the process (a dynamic model of the arm), the actuator (viscoelastic muscles), and the realized trajectory are all readily accessible via measurement and modeling. The underlying framework should be extensible to whole-body movement or even more abstract, psychological processes.

Collectively, the general problem of being able to best extract someone's intent is critical to many fields, and hinges on our understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which control is accomplished. We have excellent models of the mechanical properties of arm and muscle because the physics that describe their gross behavior is so well-understood and the need to determine particular physical parameter values has long been clear. This wealth of previous work provides strong footing for our technique, which in turn should yield valuable information not previously available by other means. In fields where the process and actuators are not yet well-understood, this approach may help to structure the search for them.

Here we develop and analyze a method to extract intent from disturbed movement, which will allow us to observe if and how intent changes following disturbance. We employ bidirectional modeling: we convert intent into movement using a forward model so that we can examine the quality and uncertainty of converting movement to intent by intent extraction. We then explore sensitivity and failure modes using standard model analysis techniques. We also demonstrate the accuracy and utility of this on a preliminary dataset of healthy reaching movements disrupted by occasional, unpredictable disturbances. We hypothesize that this combination allows intent extraction with less uncertainty than the uncertainty naturally inherent in point-to-point reaching. We show that certain factors and measurements are more sensitive than others, and demonstrate the viability of this method for a providing a better understanding of what a person means to do when they move and are disturbed.

\section*{Methods}
The sections below describe the theoretical method, and then present our evaluations. First, we considered an idealized system using synthetic data that demonstrated the concept and provided an understanding of the computational process. Next we conducted an experiment on humans and the process was then evaluated on human subject data. 

\subsection*{Intent Extraction: Deducing the Desired Trajectory}
We first demonstrate the \textit{intent extraction} approach in human motor control, but we later show that the process is applicable to any controlled process with an invertible highest order plant term. The process begins by presuming a model of the controller. Here, we choose the well-known motion control structure of Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi\cite{shadmehr1994adaptive} where the feedforward aspect of the controller perfectly predicts the plant and linearizes the system through cancellation. Additionally, linear feedback rejects position and velocity error. More complex models can be used without any loss of generality. The equation governing the passive planar dynamics (plant) of musculoskeletal structure is of the form:
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{\overbrace{M(q)\ddot{q}}^{\text{Inertia}}+\overbrace{G(q,\dot{q})}^{\text{Coriolis, Centripal}}}_{\text{Plant}}+E=0
\end{equation}
Where $M$ is the mass matrix, $q$ is the joint angles, $G$ contains both Coriolis and centripetal effects, and $E$ is externally-applied torque that the system might interact with. Dots ($\dot{q}, \ddot{q}$) are used to denote time derivatives of the joint angles. The motion behavior changes with the addition of feedforward and/or feedback controllers:
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{\overbrace{M(q)\ddot{q}}^{\text{Inertia}}+\overbrace{G(q,\dot{q})}^{\text{Coriolis, Centripal}}}_{\text{Plant}}+E=\underbrace{\overbrace{\hat{M}(q_d)\ddot{q}_d}^{\text{Inertia}}+\overbrace{\hat{G}(q_d,\dot{q}_d)}^{\text{Coriolis, Centripal}}+\hat{E}}_{\text{Feedforward Controller}}+\underbrace{K_p(q_d-q)+K_d(\dot{q}_d-\dot{q})}_{\text{Impendance, Feedback Controller}}
\end{equation}
Where a hat ($\hat{ }$) over term indicates the nervous system's best estimate of the planar dynamics, also known as the internal model. This portion of the system serves as an inverse-dynamics feedforward controller that cancels out the dynamics of the arm. If the nervous system has sufficient experience and is expecting $E$, it is included as part of the internal model, $\hat{E}$, otherwise $\hat{E}$ is set to zero. $K_p$ and $K_d$ are the lumped impedance and feedback terms that employ a moving state equilibrium to accomplish the desired trajectory, $q_d$. This $q_d$ signifies the unknown desired trajectory that we seek to discover.

For typical dynamic simulations, in order to determine the trajectory the system (i.e., the forward dynamics problem), this second order differential equation requires standard numerical integration to determine the solution to the initial value problem in time. This first involves algebraic manipulation to solve for $\ddot{q}$, and then integration to determine the state trajectory. The intent extraction approach modifies this method by instead solving for $\ddot{q}_d$:
\begin{equation}
\ddot{q}_d=\hat{M}(q_d)^{-1}\left\{M(q)\ddot{q}+G(q,\dot{q})+E-[\hat{G}(q_d,\dot{q}_d)+\hat{E}+K_p(q_d-q)+K_d(\dot{q}_d-\dot{q})]\right\}
\end{equation}  
$\ddot{q}_d$ can then be integrated to determine the intended state trajectory $q_d(t)$. Provided the model of plant and controller are precise, the initial conditions are available and accurate, the mass matrix estimate $\hat{M}$ is invertible, and the constants are accurate and do not vary, and externally-applied force can be accurately measured, then system yields an accurate estimate of the intent.

It is important to distinguish our intended trajectory, $x_d$, from another variable often considered, the equilibrium point of the muscle actuators. Importantly, this has been claimed to be the intended movement. To consider this, we also generalize our approach to any system with a moving intention that governs the control law. This introduces two additional layers of complexity by separating the plant (arm) into its process (dynamics) and actuator components (muscles) and considering the actuator's equilibrium, $x_e$ (sometimes represented as $\lambda$). The feedforward component must use and share this actuator and hence use the actuator's equilibrium. Without loss of generality, we represent the process $P$ and actuator $A$ as linear (or linearizable) operations in some space, $x$:
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{\overbrace{\sum_{n=1}^N P_nx^{(n)}}^\text{Process}+\overbrace{\sum_{m=1}^M A_m(x-x_e)^{(m)}}^\text{Actuator}}_\text{Plant}+E=0
\end{equation}
The internal model of the process ($\hat{P}$ and $\hat{E}$) predicts system actions, external disturbances, and impedance responses in order to determine $x_e$ that $x$ will track a desired path $x_d$.    
\begin{equation}
\overbrace{\sum_{n=1}^N \hat{P}_n x^{(n)}_d+\hat{E}}^\text{Internal Model}+\overbrace{\sum_{m=1}^M A_m(x_d-x_e)^{(m)}}^\text{Actuator}=0
\end{equation}
We solve this for $x_e$ and substituting into eq 4 gives:
\begin{equation}
\overbrace{\sum_{n=1}^N P_nx^{(n)}}^\text{Process}+E=\overbrace{\sum_{n=1}^N \hat{P}_n x^{(n)}_d+\hat{E}}^\text{Internal Model}+\overbrace{\sum_{m=1}^M A_m (x_d-x)^{(m)}}^\text{Feedback (Actuator)}
\end{equation}

Note $x_e$ vanishes, recovering our familiar model. While a proper choice of $x_e$ is critical to control, our approach does not require a model relating equilibrium and intended trajectory. Note also that the actuator's equilibrium $x_e$ is not the process's equilibrium unless all derivatives of $x_d$ are zero. This upholds Gomi and Kawato's finding that the arm muscles' equilibrium does not represent reaching intent\cite{gomi1997human}.

In summary, if the highest order coefficient of the process $\hat{P}_N$ can be inverted and the impedances can be modeled, it is possible to solve for $x_d^{(N)}$ and integrate for $x_d$ revealing the intended trajectory. This general form reveals the conditions needed to solve for the moving intent of an arbitrary dynamic process. 

\subsection*{Generation of synthetic data using simple dynamic simulation}
We choose one prevailing arm model, that of Burdet et al. \cite{burdet2006stability}, along with the anatomical mass distribution and geometry parameters of Winter \cite{winter2009biomechanics} to create a model for estimating intent. The model of Burdet et al \cite{burdet2006stability} was adapted to reflect measured physical parameters of the subject who provided the reach. Segment lengths were measured directly while gross body mass was self-reported. These values were converted to segment masses, centers of gravity, and moments of inertia using anatomical landmarks and values from Dempster \cite{dempster1955space} and Winter \cite{winter2009biomechanics}. The muscle torque used to calculate stiffness was approximated by looking backward in time a small amount (500 microseconds). Desired trajectory in time was simulated as a minimum jerk, 5th order polynomial of duration 700ms starting and ending with zero velocity and acceleration.
Simulated reaches were 15 cm long, beginning 38 cm out from and 5.7 cm left of the right shoulder then proceeding right.  We used the following types of perturbing forces for each combination of distance and direction: 
Pulse forces applied in one of the the two directions perpendicular to the direction of movement began when the subject had moved either 10\% or 50\% of the distance to the target and lasted for 150ms.
Noise forces began once the subject moved 3 mm, and lasted for the duration of the motion. The forces were drawn from a white noise generator at 1000 Hz with flat power spectral density of 1N, and then passed through a 4th order low-pass Butterworth filter with cutoff $10\pi$ rad/s. 

\subsection*{Error Metric}
Our error metric used deviation in position, where unsigned error was calculated as the mean magnitude of deviation from the nominal trajectory across each of 150 1mm wide bins spaced evenly throughout the 15cm reach.  Mean unsigned error (MUE) was also used to summarize the overall error in each movement for sensitivity analysis. Maximum unsigned error, also called maximum perpendicular distance, was used to measure reaching accuracy to avoid sensitivity to duration of inspection.

\subsection*{Indices of variance-based sensitivity}
Sobol-distributed matrices were generated using MATLAB's sobolset() function and converted to parameter distributions (see Table~\ref{tab:parameters}) using inverse cumulative probability density. Distributions were clamped to the range of $\pm3$ standard deviations in order to avoid support for implausible parameter values. Combinations and calculations were made as prescribed by Saltelli et al. \cite{saltelli2010variance} to arrive at direct and total sensitivity indices.

\subsection*{Human Subjects}
The human data trajectories analyzed here are drawn from a four subjects who gave informed consent in accordance with Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. Two male and two female right-handed subjects (ages 24 to 30) performed the reaches with their right arm and were not compensated. Subjects' arm segment lengths were directly measured \textit{in situ} while body mass was self-reported.

\subsection*{Apparatus}
A planar manipulandum (described in Patton and Mussa-Ivaldi \cite{patton2004robot}) was programmed to compensate and minimize any handle friction or mass. The MATLAB XPC-TARGET package \cite{MATLAB:2008} was used to render this force environment at 1000 Hz and data were collected at 1000 Hz.  Visual feedback was performed at 60 Hz using OpenGL. Closed loop data transmission time (position measurement to completed rendering to recognition of rendering by the position measurement system) was less than 8 ms, ensuring a visual delay less than one 60 Hz frame.

\subsection*{Protocol}
Subjects made 730 reaches in total, along a line parallel to their coronal plane and approximately 45 cm from their shoulder. Reaches were either 15 or 30 cm long, starting and ending at one of three points spaced 15 cm apart on the line. To prevent any learning effect, forces were presented intermittently with random frequency, but never less than 5 reaches apart. Forces were chosen pseudorandomly such that each type, direction, and distance combination mentioned above was presented 5 times.  

\subsection*{Statistical Analysis}
The MATLAB statistics toolbox package \cite{MATLAB:2008} was used to perform comparisons among subjects and trajectory sources using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Tukey-Kramer post-hoc for group differences. Nonparametric testing was necessary due to floor effects from using unsigned measures.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Model Robustness}
Sensitivity analysis fortunately revealed that variance in intended trajectories due to estimated uncertainty in model parameters is lower than the natural variation in undisturbed motions.  Simulated point-to-point reaches disturbed by either filtered white noise forces or a pulse force perpendicular to the direction of the reach (figure 1) were extracted in the presence of 220,000 variations upon the parameters (table 1) according to the methods of Saltelli et al. \cite{saltelli2010variance}. Expected variance due to parameter uncertainty was $0.86  \mu m^2$ for pulse forces and $1.5 \mu m^2$ for filtered white forces. Variance in recorded undisturbed point-to-point reaching under the same time and reach distance conditions was $2.93 \mu m^2$. These variances all fall beneath the instantaneous accuracy of the robot recording the motion (tenths of a millimeter). In other words, while some inversion processes might be highly sensitive to model uncertainty, our process for recovering intent from action is much more precise than its input.

\subsection*{Parameter Sensitivity}
Simulated error due to direct parameter uncertainty (figure 2) reached the order of millimeters and revealed particular sensitivity to misestimation of stiffness and changes in shoulder position from trial to trial. Indirect sensitivity, which reveals how errors from other parameters are affected by changes in a given parameter, was an order of magnitude lower than direct sensitivity and again implicated stiffness estimation inaccuracy as a primary cause of extraction uncertainty. Note that this sensitivity analysis does not provide information on whether models or parameter estimates are accurate, only how sensitive the model would be if they were inaccurate. 

\subsection*{Human Intent Trajectories}
Extraction of intent from human point-to-point reaching revealed straight-line movement that persisted for hundreds of milliseconds after the onset of disturbing forces (figure 3). In both pulse timing conditions, intent remained straight line towards the target, supporting the approach.  When disturbances occurred early in reaching, intent showed some signs of correction mid-reach. When disturbances occurred late in reaching, intent continued onto the target (figure 3 lower plots). We observed a systematic change of intent 150 milliseconds after the onset of force disturbance. While the hand returns within 600 milliseconds to undisturbed levels of error, intention is altered for almost 900 milliseconds (figure 4 shaded areas). 

As this is the first sound method for looking at intent following disturbance, we have only the undisturbed intention for comparison. If intent can change following disturbance, it can only do so after some period of time due to delay in processing sensory information and producing new motor commands. This represents a way to falsify the method: our determined intent should not diverge from the undisturbed intent of similar motions within this window of delay. As demonstrated in figure 4, the method passes this test until 150 milliseconds after the onset of disturbance. Further

\section*{Discussion}
We sought to test the suitability and robustness of an algorithm that determines a person's intent during reaching motion, even if there disturbances. Sensitivity analysis on synthetic data revealed that the method was suitable in that errors in response to parameter variations were smaller than trial-to-trial variance observed in human reaching. Significant misestimation could occur if the stiffness was inaccurately modelled. We tested this on human reaching and found that in spite of the hand being distubed by forces, the intended movement remained on-course to the target until 120-150 ms before responding. This represents a new and accurate method for viewing intent and how it changes when faced with a force disturbance.

While the derivation of intent determination required many steps, the outcome is a filter whose use is straight-forward. Many filters for converting assumed intent into simulated hand trajectories have been proposed and validated. Demonstrating the validity and plausibility of inverting those filters to determine intent from hand trajectory adds a novel method to the arsenal of analytical methods for exploring human motor control.

This approach explains the discovery by Bizzi et al. \cite{bizzi1984posture} of a ``virtual trajectory'' ($\alpha$) in deafferented monkeys that progressed smoothly from the initial to final positions and how that virtual trajectory is different from $\lambda$. By deriving the technique in a general form, we discovered that our $x_d$ can be used to determine the muscle equilibrium of a $\lambda$ model and that they are only equivalent when $x_d$ is not changing.  Even if the muscle equilibrium jumped abruptly, this would be insufficient to move the intended trajectory abruptly due to the presence of a virtual mass. This provides a striking and falsifiable prediction: reaching intention cannot jump abruptly.

Not only is intent slow to change, it does not necessarily change following disturbance. While this work examines the time of onset of change, statistical testing cannot be used to detect the absence of change in an individual movement. Still, figure 3 shows reaches that are more compatible with intermittent control than with continuous optimal feedback control. In classic optimal control, the system is always updating the intent in response to errors \cite{todorov2002optimal}. Our results suggest a latent response consistent with sensory feedback latencies \cite{pruszynski2012optimal}. Interestingly, disturbances that come later in the movement (figure 3, bottom panel) appeared to not dramatically affect some subjects' intent, suggesting that people may stubbornly ``stick to their guns'' when they know that the stiffness and damping characteristics will provide enough restoring torque to arrive at the target. Time of response may be dependent on the time of the disturbance in the movement. Alternatively, control might be intermittent \cite{gawthrop2011intermittent} with limited opportunities to change intent. It remains to be seen if and how change in intent might be triggered. 

Determination of intent may facilitate may facilitate motor training and stroke recovery. Error augmentation, which presently relies on dictating the reaching intent, has demonstrated the capacity to increase and speed up learning in healthy patients \cite{patton2004robot} and following stroke \cite{patton2006evaluation}. This static, dictated intent could be replaced By instead scaling the magnitude of the difference between the desired and realized trajectory, error augmentation during undirected reaching and exploration becomes possible. This permits both error reduction and error magnification. Partial error cancellation would allow learning to take place without harm to task goals. As demonstrated by the success of the challenge-point framework \cite{guadagnoli2004challenge}, dynamic variation of augmentation as task learning progresses can be beneficial. With this extraction, error can be measured and augmented in real-time even without an explicit task, potentially enabling wider utility and application. 

Determination of intended trajectories from force-disturbed movements allows hypothesis testing that was not previously possible. It is important to reiterate that because the human arm’s mass is almost always invertible, this approach can take \textbf{any} ``candidate model'' of the human arm and create a filter that estimates the intended trajectory. By using tests such as the comparison with undisturbed straight line reaching employed in this paper, one can evaluate which candidate produces the most plausible intended trajectory, supporting one model over another.  Instead of comparing two generative models to see which better approximates movement, it is now possible to perform element-by-element fitting. Mid-movement replanning is now falsifiable: do intended trajectories from disturbed motions differ from undisturbed motions? They do. Similarly, compositional claims, such as whether movements are comprised of subunits, should now be directly testable. Finally, optimal feedback control models can now gain direct access to an intended trajectory to better understand and fit hypothesized cost functions.

The plant model does not need to be explicitly formulated. Dynamic models that strive to understand intent are wide ranging, and can include mathematical models that range in application from national security to athletic performance. The plant (such as the actions of a crowd in a crowded square, the motions of the opposing team,) may be too complex to model with simple linear transformations as we present above. However, by substituting some approximation or lookup table of input-outcome pairs, it is possible in a variety of applications to obtain the intent, even when disturbed. It is not necessarily to allow a bomb to explode or the opposing team to be victorious to understand the plan behind their action.

Nevertheless, there are some limitations to these methods.  One limiting requirement is that accurate interface force measurement (within a few tenths of a newton) is needed. Such instrumentation is available, but must be used with great care in order to preserve the accuracy of the estimate. Our sensitivity analysis on synthetic data revealed that slight error can lead to a trajectory that accumulates a drift due to bias caused by the force term. More importantly, while modern force sensors can be highly accurate with very high signal to noise ratios, they tend to drift over time, leading to error that can grow if the device is not periodically tared. Our empirical approach used several methods to mitigate these effects, and hence the errors became small. It remains to be seen if there are methods to further reduce the misestimation due to force error or eliminate the need for force estimation altogether.  

The approximation of stiffness appears to be the most critical factor in accuracy in estimating intent. While serious trial-to-trial stiffness misestimation is unlikely, co-contraction in response to disturbance might plausibly double stiffness mid-reach. Even as the model is insensitive to normal variations, a human can volitionally halve or double their stiffness \cite{franklin2007endpoint}. Co-contraction is plausible and has significant impact on accuracy. These limitations are readily overcome by performing this sensitivity analysis on each force environment of interest and taking measures to detect co-contraction and hence stiffness alterations. Additionally, real-time determination of intent may allow real-time determination of stiffness.

Our simple linear scaling of Burdet et al.'s stiffness model \cite{burdet2006stability} facilitated hypothesis testing, but was inherently limiting. More accurate approaches would provide us with too many free parameters through which to determine the outcome of the eventual extraction and obtain a spurious favorable result. Our results point to the possibility of the impedance changing during motion, perhaps as a function of time. As mentioned above, while this may be perceived as a shortcoming, it was necessary and potentially facilitates real-time determination of stiffness in future work.

The general intent extraction approach presented here reveals the conditions needed to solve for the moving intent in an arbitrary dynamic process.

\begin{flushleft}Synthetic model parameters and their associated mean (nominal) values and standard deviations (SD) used to determine the sensitivity indices of Saltelli et al. \cite{saltelli2010variance}. Also shown are the resulting sensitivity indices. Sensitivity indices less than one-thousandth of the total sensitivity were reported as zero. Total sensitivity was $1.3 \mu m^2$, showing very small average deviations when using this approach. First order sensitivity, $S$, can be interpreted as fraction of variance removable by perfectly correcting a factor while total sensitivity, $S_T$ can be interpreted as the fraction left after correcting all other factors.
