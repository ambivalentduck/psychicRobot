Processing steps.

1. Generate the experiment. 
-Need to go through the git commits and see what algorithm was actually used.
--Or just test the hypothesis that it's Poisson and never less than 4.

2. Collect the data

3. Fix the force sensor

4. Presume stupid things about mass and height. 
-Fit 3 fudges: mass, height, kp
--As in paper 1, but only 3 groups this time. Or 6...I guess.

5. Extract
-Already automated

6. Decompose
-Already automated

7. Plot and stuff...no different than what's already there
