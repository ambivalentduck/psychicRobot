Unstable and uncertain environments are an everyday problem that affects piloting and input devices in human-machine interaction. Here we experimentally evaluate intent feedback (IF), which estimates and displays the human operator’s underlying intent in real-time. IF is a filter that combines a model of the arm with position and force data to determine the intended position. Subjects performed targeted reaching motions while seeing either their hand position or their intent estimate as a cursor while they experienced white noise forces rendered by a robotic handle. We found significantly better reaching performance during force exposure using the estimated intent. Additionally, IF reduced estimated arm stiffness to about half that without IF, indicating a more relaxed state of operation. While visual distortions typically degrade performance and require an adaptation period to overcome, this particular distortion immediately enhances performance. In the future, this method could provide novel insights into the nature of control. IF might also be applied in driving and piloting applications to best follow a person’s desire in unpredictable or turbulent conditions.

\section{Introduction}

% For Original Research Articles, Clinical Trial Articles, and Technology Reports the introduction should be succinct, with no subheadings.
Humans often interact with machines in uncertain and complicated environments, such as crowds and traffic, where they must contend with turbulence, moving obstacles, distractions, and disturbances. Despite our capacity to learn and adapt, some environments evolve too quickly or with too much uncertainty for meaningful learning. Sensory delays, sensory fusion, delays in sensory processing, and delays in action further confound our ability to behave reactively. The nervous system intelligently solves many problems by planning ahead \citep{belen1967control}, yet in the face of uncertainties we often cannot adequately prevent errors. There is the possibility, however, to exploit additional information from instruments that may be available -- particularly fast and accurate force sensors -- that can measure human machine interactions. Combining sensors with filtering techniques makes it possible to determine a person’s underlying intent -- the motion they would have done if they had not been disturbed. This intent provides new ways to understand the nature of control and provide novel feedback. 

Recent work in our laboratory has attempted to outline the methodology for obtaining estimates of intent \citep{horowitz2015determining}. This method assumes a model of the dynamics and control of the human arm, and then through a manipulation of the equations of motion it integrates to find a unique estimate of intent. The algorithm recovers the trajectory a person intended to take, even if they were forced away from it due to environmental disturbances. This analysis has enabled us to show how subjects might sometimes alter their intent following exposure to unexpected force pulses. 

A new question that arises is whether seeing one’s own intent, rather that what what actually happens, may be useful. The intent extraction method can be abriged to allow for real-time estimations and presented to the subject as a cursor. It is possible that performance using this estimated intention may compare quite favorably to the actual outcome in the presence of unexpected disturbances. If so, such a method holds great promise in any situation where humans and machines interact as it enables the machine to give the human operator what they want. This human-machine collaboration might be able to outperform what a person can do alone.

In contrast, displaying anything other than what truthfully happens is a distortion and a lie. Like many other visual distortion experiments \citep{miles1980long, pine1996learning}, intent feedback (IF) introduces a visuomotor discrepancy that may be confusing to the nervous system. Preplanning a specific route may not necessary, and instead the system might continuously react to the environmental disturbances until it reaches the goal. If people try to achieve a goal while minimizing some measure of cost, it is possible to compute a set of rules for reacting to the environment without a specific intended route using optimal feedback control\citep{todorov2002optimal}. While this modeling strategy has been very successful at explaining data, it fundamentally assumes that corrective actions will be taken in response to relevant disturbances. Goals can also be reached at minimal \textit{expected} cost by constructing -- and possibly updating -- a specific intended route. IF may be troublesome if the nervous system cannot recognize it because no particular trajectory was intended.

While performance is the best indicator of IF's value, changes in arm stiffness can provide supporting evidence that subjects are actually getting what they want. Arm stiffness is known to increase during exposure to instability \citep{franklin2003adaptation} and uncertainty \citep{takahashi2001impedance}. We anticipated that these changes might also be modulated by presentation of IF. Reducing the effects of environmental instability and presenting the subject with a signal already known to them should make the arm relax and become more compliant. We hypothesized that any elevated arm stiffness from noisy disturbances would decrease when subjects received IF.

In this paper we describe our abridged method for real-time IF, and then expose subjects to IF in an unstable and unpredictable environment to compare their ability to perform goal-directed reaching using visual feedback of their hand position against visual feedback of their estimated intended position. We hypothesized that IF should lead to better performance in the presence of force-based disturbances. Accordingly, we hypothesized that during random disturbances, the intent trajectory should deviate less than the hand.

\begin{methods}
\section{Material \& Methods}

\subsection{Intent Extraction}
The well-known motion control structure of Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi\cite{shadmehr1994adaptive} relates arm trajectory, $q$, to desired arm trajectory, $q_d$, and any external disturbance, $E$ using physical parameters of the arm. To show how this model can be algebraically inverted to instead describe desired arm trajectory as a function of arm trajectory and external disturbance, we write it as a torque balance:
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{\overbrace{M(q)\ddot{q}}^{\text{Inertia}}+\overbrace{G(q,\dot{q})}^{\text{Coriolis, Centripal}}}_{\text{Plant}}+E=
\underbrace{\overbrace{\tau_{ff}}^{\text{Feedforward}}+\overbrace{\tau_{fb}}^{\text{Feedback}}}_\text{Controller}
\end{equation}
Where $M$ is the mass matrix, $q$ is the joint angles, $\dot{q}$ is joint angular velocities, $\ddot{q}$ is joint angular accelerations, and $G$ contains both Coriolis and centripetal effects. Typical applications solve this torque balance for $\ddot{q}$ and use a numerical differential equation solver to predict arm trajectory in the context of a disturbance of interest, a feedback model, and feedforward torques determined by inverse dynamics. Rather than test hypotheses regarding the learning, production, or composition of this feedforward torque, we instead solve for it:
\begin{equation}
\tau_{ff}=M(q)\ddot{q}+G(q,\dot{q})+E-\tau_{fb}
\end{equation}
Then we note that feedforward torque can have a one-to-one correspondence with desired acceleration, $\ddot{q}_d$:
\begin{equation}
\hat{M}(q_d)\ddot{q}_d+\hat{G}(q_d,\dot{q}_d)+\hat{E}=\tau_{ff}
\end{equation}
Hats ( $\hat{}$ ) denote the nervous system's best estimate of a physical quantity. Combining these expressions, suppressing state dependencies, and solving for $\ddot{q}_d$:
\begin{equation}
\ddot{q}_d=\hat{M}^{-1} \{M\ddot{q}+G-\hat{G}+E-\hat{E}-\tau_{fb}\}
\end{equation}
In this form, a differential equation solver can determine $q_d$ as it evolves in time if a few assumptions are made and conditions are met. First, $\hat{E}$ must be modeled or assumed, so we choose $\hat{E}=0$. In the presence of a zero mean white noise force disturbance its mean should be zero, but it is unlikely to be exactly zero and may reflect an average of only the last few exposures\citep{scheidt2001learning}. Next, the matrix $\hat{M}(q_d)$ must be invertible, but we can ensure this through our choice of workspace. Finally, feedback torque requires a model of arm impedance, which is known to be task-dependent\citep{gomi1998task} and may vary over the course of a reach\citep{niu2010temporal}. With no prior knowledge of arm impedance for this task-disturbance combination, we presumed the feedback torque model of Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi anticipating that it is sufficiently accurate or easy to learn (experiment 1). The experiment was repeated with a lower stiffness estimate (experiment 2) to explore any dependence on this assumption.

\subsection{Apparatus}
A planar manipulandum (described in Patton and Mussa-Ivaldi \cite{patton2004robot}) was programmed to minimize any friction or mass. The MATLAB XPC-TARGET package \citep{MATLAB:2008} was used to render this force environment at 1000 Hz and data were collected at 1000 Hz.  Visual feedback of cursor position was performed at 60 Hz using OpenGL. Closed-loop data transmission time (position measurement to completed rendering to recognition of rendering by the position measurement system) was less than 8 milliseconds, ensuring a visual delay less than one 60 Hz frame. Numerical simulation was performed in real-time using the GNU Scientific Library's odeiv2 driver with Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (4,5) stepping\cite{gough2009gnu}.

\subsection{Human Subjects}
The human data trajectories analyzed here are drawn from nine subjects who gave informed consent in accordance with Northwestern University Institutional Review Board, which specifically approved this study and follows the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Seven male and one female right-handed subjects (ages 21 to 30) performed the reaches with their right arm and were not compensated. Subjects' arm segment lengths were directly measured \textit{in situ} while body mass was self-reported.

\subsection{Experimental Design}
We chose 15 centimeters long, center-out reaches of the right arm to visually-presented targets chosen at 60 degree intervals about that central point. Target selection was carried out pseudorandomly such that each outer target was visited 16 times in each of 5 blocks of 96 reaches each. During blocks 2 through 4, subjects experienced filtered white noise forces drawn from a white noise generator at 1000 Hertz with flat power spectral density of 1 Newton, and then passed through a 4th order low-pass Butterworth filter with cutoff $10 \pi$ radians per second. During block 3, cursor position indicated deduced intent. During all other blocks, the cursor position indicated hand position (Figure 2A).

\subsection{Dynamic simulation of arm and intended trajectories}
Anatomical landmarks and values from Dempster \cite{dempster1955space} and Winter \cite{winter2009biomechanics} were used to estimate relationships between body mass and limb mass, limb length and limb center of mass, and limb mass and length and moment of inertia. Viscosity parameters, $K_d$, were taken from Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi\cite{shadmehr1994adaptive}. Stiffness parameters were either taken from Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi\cite{shadmehr1994adaptive} ($K_{P1}$, experiment 1) or estimated ($K_{P2}$, experiment 2). Expressed in Newton-Meters per Radian:
\begin{equation}
K_{P1}=
\begin{bmatrix}
15 & 6 \\
6 & 16
\end{bmatrix}
\quad
K_{P2}=
\begin{bmatrix}
8 & 2 \\
2 & 5
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
To estimate this reduced stiffness, a pilot subject was asked to intend to remain still on the center target, $q_d$, while co-contracting as little as possible. $K_{P2}$ was then calculated from one minute of white noise forces, $E$, and joint angle traces, $q$ as the least squares solution to the system:
\begin{equation}
K_{P2}\big(q_d(t)-q(t)\big)=M\big(q(t)\big)\ddot{q}(t)+G(q(t),\dot{q}(t))+E(t)+K_D\dot{q}(t)
\end{equation}
where $K_{P2}$ is a 2-by-2 matrix while the state difference and torque are 2-by-60000 matrices.

\subsection{Metrics and Statistical Analysis}
Trajectories and forces were rotated such that movement and force parallel to the line connecting the previous target (the reach origin) and the presented target lie along a \textit{progress} axis while perpendicular movement and force lie along an \textit{error} axis. Reach onset was detected as the moment the cursor's distance from the center of the previous target first exceeded 1 centimeter. Maximum perpendicular error for a trajectory was the largest error magnitude within 250 milliseconds of reach onset. A scalar stiffness, $k$, was calculated for the \textit{error} axis during this same 250 millisecond time span by linear regression:
\begin{equation}
F_e=m\ddot{e}+b\dot{e}+ke+F_O
\end{equation}
Force ($F_e$) and state ($\ddot{e}$, $\dot{e}$, $e$) were known. Mass ($m$), viscosity ($b$), and stiffness offset ($F_0$) terms were calculated, but discarded. While joint stiffness is usually described as a matrix, instantaneous endpoint stiffness in only the error direction is a scalar. This metric isolates stiffness in the error direction and facilitates statistical comparison between treatments and blocks. The paired Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to detect differences in maximum perpendicular error and stiffness between blocks and treatments at the 5\% significance level using the MATLAB statistics toolbox package \cite{MATLAB:2014}.
\end{methods}


\section{Results}
As expected, the model was able to deduce an intended trajectory and all subjects were able to utilize this estimate of their intent to perform targeted reaching while experiencing turbulent forces (Figure 1). The following sections address the quality of this reaching.

\begin{figure}[h]

\framebox{\parbox{3in}{\includegraphics{Yplots.eps}

\caption{Typical subjects made center-out targeted reaching motions under experimentally varied force and feedback conditions. Subjects used feedback of either hand motions (black lines) or estimated intent (red lines) to complete these reaches. Intent was estimated using either the stiffness model of Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi\cite{shadmehr1994adaptive} (Experiment 1) or a reduced stiffness (Experiment 2) to explore any dependence of reaching stiffness or accuracy on this assumption. The white noise force disturbance was designed to be unpredictable in order to minimize any effect of learning.}

\caption{Subjects' reaching accuracy depended on the presence of force disturbance and the contents of visual feedback (A). Maximum deviation from straight-line reaching calculated during the first 250 milliseconds after the onset of movement revealed that turbulent force disturbance degraded reaching performance in both hand (B) and intent (C). Comparisons within treatment conditions revealed a significant advantage for the hand when force disturbance is not present and a significant advantage for intent when feedback of intent was used during exposure to turbulent forces. Performance using intent during turbulence was significantly better than performance using the hand (D). Significance among comparisons is denoted by an asterisk. Error did not signficantly depend on the choice between Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi's\cite{shadmehr1994adaptive} stiffness model (experiment 1, blue) or a reduced stiffness (experiment 2, red) to determine intent.}
\label{error}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Reaching Accuracy}
Even if subjects were capable of performing a reaching task using their estimated intent, a poor estimate would have lead to poor performance. Indeed, the hand significantly outperformed our intent estimate when the force disturbance is not present in block 1 (Figure 2D). Model and sensor inaccuracies degrade performance and result in an error of approximately 5 millimetres. In the presence of a force disturbance in block 2, the hand loses its advantage as model and sensor inaccuracies are balanced by some degree of cancellation of the disturbance. In block 3 where visual feedback of the intent is given instead of hand, the intent significantly outperforms the hand. For this intent estimate to be useful, subjects should perform better when using feedback of the intent than when using feedback of the hand. Comparing the hand's performance in block 2 to the intent's performance in block 3, subjects performed significantly better using their estimated intent. Finally, no significant differences were present across the two experiments. Performance was relatively insensitive to this change in the stiffness model used to deduce the intent.

\subsection*{Endpoint Stiffness}
While accuracy is desirable, it can be attained by co-contracting muscles to increase arm stiffness at the cost of metabolic effort \citep{gribble2003role, takahashi2001impedance}. Subjects stiffened significantly in response to white noise forces as seen by comparing stiffness in blocks 1 and 2 (Figure 3C). Subjects' stiffness significantly decreased when feedback of the deduced intent replaced feedback of the hand, as seen by comparing blocks 2 and 3. This decrease does not return stiffness to undisturbed levels, and it remains even after feedback of the hand resumes as seen by comparing blocks 3 and 4. Stiffness may have decreased with duration of exposure to uncertain disturbances\citep{takahashi2001impedance}. Subjects did not appear to have adjusted their stiffness to match the stiffness used in the estimation as subject and model stiffnesses were significantly different in experiment 2.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\framebox{\parbox{3in}{\includegraphics{stiffness.eps}
}}
\caption{Subjects' arm stiffness depended on the presence of force disturbance and the contents of visual feedback (A). Arm stiffness calculated by linear regression during the first 250 milliseconds after the onset of movement revealed that turbulent force disturbance increased arm stiffness (B). Comparisons between treatment conditions revealed that exposure to turbulent forces caused by arm to stiffen significantly, but feedback of intent could significantly reduce this increase (C). Stiffness did not signficantly depend on the choice between Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi's\cite{shadmehr1994adaptive} stiffness model (experiment 1, blue) or a reduced stiffness (experiment 2, red) to determine intent.}

\section{Discussion}

Although exposure to random forces damaged subjects’ reaching accuracy and increased their arm stiffness, replacing the veridical feedback with IF alleviated accuracy and stiffness. While other visual distortions typically degrade performance and require an adaptation period to overcome, IF immediately enhances performance. The simplest explanation for this is that IF approximates a signal already known to the brain: the path planned for the hand. In addition to its promise in performance enhancement, IF represents a novel means of revealing and studying the mechanisms of planning and control.

While IF alleviated the increased stiffness caused by exposure to random forces, stiffness remained significantly above baseline levels. Many explanations are reasonable. In particular, we might have hypothesized that the stiffness model used to determine intent might bias a person's arm stiffness, but the data did not support this conclusion. Alternatively, we might hypothesize that inaccuracy and incompleteness of the models used results in an estimate of intent that less accurate than subjects might desire. Since noise and performance inaccuracy can both be addressed by co-contraction, this may account for the remaining additional stiffness. Finally, it is possible that subjects co-contracted simply to counteract any residual perceived instability due to our slight lag in processing and presenting feedback.



Specific planned state trajectory even in the absence of explicit kinematic constraints.

Of particular scientific interest, "strict invariant" which has been described as opposite optimal feedback control.


Stiffness decreased, which provides secondary evidence of lower instability and unpredictability. Well, maybe it's just because of the numbers we chose. If we crank them down, can we get the stiffness even lower? Not so much. So clearly getting the stiffness right is very important.
In the absence of disturbing forces, estimated intent accuracy was lower than
that of the hand, which suggests the need for model improvements.

 The simplest explanation for this is that IF approximates a signal already known to the brain: the path planned for the hand. If so, IF r Moreover, this immediate performance enhancement during human-machine interaction implies a means by which robots can productively interact with a human without impeding them.





While this is pretty awesome, getting the stiffness right is an enormous limitation. Moreover, the stiffness model breaks down in the vicinity of the target for reasons unknown. The nature of control might be changing there and if so, we don't really know the specifics, but Shapiro has something to say about this.

Overall, this is something of a breakthrough
