make a few trajectories
-early
-late
-5 white

1. So, 5 plots. Save the current white as white1, because 15 hours invested and why not.
2. From there...essentially read xvaf/yex info from an array and do the variance-based sim on it.
2a. Regenerate figure 2 (maybe each time)
3. Figure three is maybe something that can be done on the lappy tomorrow?
4. Show where extraction diverges. Requires 3a. Again, lappy?
