Sanity checking and checking against known "correct" implementation.

Stability and motor adaptation in human arm movements, Burdet, Milner, Franklin, Kawato. Trustworthy stuff.

1. Check sign conventions on torques, joint angles, xy, etc.
-Checks out. Quirk: my q1 = their q1 + 180 degrees. 
XXXXX This can technically be a red flag later, but theoretically passes muster now.
XXXXX Possibly quirks on force handle that cause the negation given the 180 degree rotation of the world. Appears to check out.

2. ikin/fkin drift should be minimal.
-Previously done, untouched.
-No observable drift over 5000 iterations

3. Basic dynamics/computeDC.m
-Sign conventions appear identical, so should BE identical.
XXXXX Caught a sign difference in the first element of the coriolis vector.

4. Multiple implementations of the forward and inverse dyamics.
-Static impedance (shad and muss)
-Dynamic impedance (burdet)
-Dynamic impedance + reflexes (also burdet)

5. Trivial to check differentiation of velocity and acceleration by setting forces to zero.
-Passes
-Extraction should be perfect atop measurement.

6. Anthropomorphics generates a value very different from Shad and Muss for inertias.
XXXXX Quadruple checked. Any reasonable "oops" fix actually makes it worse.


99. Need to implement gainscaling in the controlwidget. Also a dropdown for model type



Sensitivity analyses:
0. Fundamentally need a metric of error that doesn't overstate squirreliness at the end.

By model...
1. White/uniform/biased error in force sensor.
2. Mass estimation errors (m1, m2, lc1, lc2)
3. Impedance estimation errors (kd, kp...scale linearly together?)
4. Amount of delay (delay model only)

Length estimation errors should be irrelevant.
--You've measured within a few millimeters of accuracy. Nonidealty in the joint itself leads to travel, more relevant.



Necessary components of a theory of everything:
1. How is experience fundamentally handled? (Projection onto a symbol space)
2. Given the above claim that symbols matter, how are symbols acquired?
--Man without words, some are natural
--Under stress, the symbol IS the innovation? Ie. Symbols are residuals?
3. How are symbols refined? (IF they are. Arguably this does not happen and this is instead a replacement process only.)
4. How are symbols dropped? (Bayes, give or take)
5. How are symbols combined into models? (Bayes, give or take)
--Humans can't do this until 6 years old-ish. Ie. Left of the blue wall.
6. How are models refined? (Bayes, give or take)
7. How are models translated into action? (Optimal control in a symbol space, give or take)
