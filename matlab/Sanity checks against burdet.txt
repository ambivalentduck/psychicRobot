Sanity checking and checking against known "correct" implementation.

Stability and motor adaptation in human arm movements, Burdet, Milner, Franklin, Kawato. Trustworthy stuff.

1. Check sign conventions on torques, joint angles, xy, etc.
-Checks out. Quirk: my q1 = their q1 + 180 degrees. 
XXXXX This can technically be a red flag later, but theoretically passes muster now.
XXXXX Possibly quirks on force handle that cause the negation given the 180 degree rotation of the world. Appears to check out.

2. ikin/fkin drift should be minimal.
-Previously done, untouched.

3. Basic dynamics/computeDC.m
-Sign conventions appear identical, so should BE identical.
XXXXX Caught a sign difference in the first element of the coriolis vector.

4. Multiple implementations of the forward and inverse dyamics.
-Static impedance (shad and muss)
-Dynamic impedance (burdet)
-Dynamic impedance + reflexes (also burdet)
